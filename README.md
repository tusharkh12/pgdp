# PGDP - Programming and Data Processing

This repository contains all my coursework and projects from the Programming and Data Processing (PGDP) course. The course covers fundamental programming concepts, data structures, algorithms, and practical programming exercises in Java.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

The repository is organized by academic year and week, following the pattern:
- `pgdp[YEAR][SEMESTER][TYPE][WEEK]-[IDENTIFIER]`
- Example: `pgdp2122w01h01-ge42bax` = 2021/22 Winter Semester, Week 01, Homework 01

### Academic Years Covered:
- **2021/22 (2122)** - Winter and Summer semesters
- **2022/23 (2223)** - Winter and Summer semesters

### Project Types:
- **h** - Homework assignments
- **p** - Practical exercises
- **b** - Bonus assignments
